YoutubeExtractor GUI application


This is a GUI application that allows you to input a direct link to a youtube video, which will then download the video and/or audio.

To make it work, all you have to do is open the program in visual studio.

You HAVE to input a youtube link before you can search for the video.

If you choose 1080p the audio cannot be extracted and I do not know why.
